## Emergency Resource Center App ##

<b>Challenge: </b> Victim services orgs and law enforcement agencies do not always have all the resources needed to serve victims of trafficking when they are recovered from exploiters. Commonly requested items include: (hotel rooms/ temporary housing, clothing, food, toiletries, transportation, etc.). Local stakeholders are willing and able to provide the resources requested, but there is no centralized communication system to match requesters with suppliers on a real time basis (e.g. middle of the night.) This project can build on the learnings and structure of the initial platform created by CEASE Portland. 


<b>Project:</b> Build on and improve upon our CEASE Portland’s existing web-based platform (Bridging the Gap) including creating a mobile application for local business and organizations to post available donations for victim service organizations. This platform will receive updates based on the individual’s geographic location. Note: the web developer will be conducting a separate live demo of the web-platform.
