## Automated Identification ##

<b>Challenge:</b> John board sites are web forums where potential and active buyers review prostituted individuals and venues (think a Yelp for paid sex). These portals fuel exploitation and increase societyâ€™s normalization of buying sex. They also contain a wealth of information on marketplace trends, buyer / exploiter behavior, illicit activity venues, and connections to victims / trafficked women.


<b>Project #1:</b> Develop a comprehensive automated reverse search platform that compares phone numbers to all openly available identification information. This tool would create individual holistic exploiter / sex buyer profiles to be utilized during law enforcement operations. Sources could include: 

<ol>
<li>Social media accounts (demographic data, common usernames, preferences, interests, etc.) </li> 
<li>Employment history</li>
<li>White pages</li>
<li>Media alerts</il>
</ol>

<i>Disclaimer: We do not encourage teams to investigate known illegal activity or suspected individuals.</i>

<b>Project #2:</b> Create a database platform that automatically syncs to known relationship tracking systems (i.e., Salesforce) for comprehensive data management.
