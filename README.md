###Code of Conduct###
Everyone who attendees will have to sign a developer agreement. If you would like to see a copy of that before the event, please email <a href="mailto:delaney_workman@huntalternatives.org" title="Title">Delaney</a>. In addition to the developer agreement, we have a few guiding principles for the weekend: 

<ol>
<li>Avoid the Batman Complex - don’t do anything illegal.</li>
<li>You might see some nasty stuff. If you ever feel uncomfortable, please come find us. </li>
<li>Please do not try to identify individual exploiters.</li>
<li>Be nice to everyone.</li>
<li>A serious topic should be taken seriously…but let’s still have fun. </li>
</ol>


###Team Organization###
Saturday morning, all attendees will hear a brief description on our proposed projects to combat sexual trafficking and exploitation. 
All attendees are welcome to come with their own project ideas to pitch to the group, or generate new ideas on-site while networking with your peers. 
Each team will have an assigned point person assigned to answer any questions related to content or available data sets. 
Team registrations will be capped at 10 individuals in order to facilitate productive conversations and project development. 
Each team will designate a representative to conduct a 5 minute demonstration of your final project at the end of the event. 
We recommend ensuring a variety of expertise is represented on each team. 


###Projects###
We will be pitching 8 different challenges to attendees. <b>Each challenge description is listed in a separate folder within this repository.</b> Please review the projects and contact us if you have any questions. 

We will also provide the opportunity for people to pitch their own project ideas. We encourage new ideas and added creativity!

###Accessing Datasets###
Several datasets are available for attendees to manipulate during the hackathon. We will provide an overview of this data on Saturday morning. 


###Using our Github###
Once teams self-organize on Saturday, we will have facilitators around the room set you up with your project repo. 


###Final Presentations###
At the end of Sunday, each designated team captain will be responsible for providing a 5 minute demonstration to our panel of judges, followed by 2 minutes of Q&A.
Below are some helpful tools and resources for making a great demo:
