##Conversation Simulator##

#Challenge: Law enforcement agencies are strapped for resources and time to conduct reverse sting operations. Text messaging is becoming a popular tool for exploiters to communicate with those advertised on escort ads. Creating a chat bot simulation would save law enforcement time and possibly extract information and evidence in an automated way. 

#Project #1: Create a chat bot that can carry out a conversation with potential sex buyers, over SMS, and extract incriminating information before being exposed.

#Project #2: Integrate the chat bot with the platform Twilio, to automate the recording of all conversations in a centralized database.
