## automated Identification ##

<b>Project Background: </b> Police agencies struggle with competing agency priorities with limited resources. Online reverse sting operations yield lower arrest ratios than traditional street stings due to these high agency costs including: officer overtime, rented hotel rooms, and inefficient use of staff time due to incomplete intelligence information. Even though we know that 60-80% of all illegal sex transactions are brokered online, online reverse stings yield smaller average arrest ratios than street stings. More comprehensive sex buyer and pimp profiles will allow officers to refine their operations and target the most violent and most frequent offenders. 

<b>Project #1:</b> Develop a comprehensive automated reverse search platform that compares phone numbers to all openly available identification information. This tool would create individual holistic exploiter / sex buyer profiles to be utilized during law enforcement operations. Sources could include: 

<ol>
<li>Social media accounts (demographic data, common usernames, preferences, interests, etc.) </li> 
<li>Employment history</li>
<li>White pages</li>
<li>Media alerts</il>
</ol>

<i>Disclaimer: We do not encourage teams to investigate known illegal activity or suspected individuals.</i>

<b>Project #2:</b> Create a database platform that automatically syncs to known relationship tracking systems (i.e., Salesforce) for comprehensive data management.
