## Top 100 Sex Reviewers ##

<b>Project Background: </b> John board sites, also known as sex buyer review sites, are web forums where potential and active buyers review prostituted individuals and venues (think a Yelp for paid sex). These portals contain a wealth of information on marketplace trends, buyer / exploiter behavior, illicit activity venues, and connections to victims / trafficked women. 

<b>Project #1:</b> Create a profiling tool that analyzes the most frequent reviewers on popular sex buyer review sites including: 

<ol>
<li>Rubmaps </li>
<ul>
<li>National massage parlor review site offering information on illicit massage parlor activity.</li>
</ul>
<li>The Erotic Review</li> 
<ul>
<li>Self-proclaimed community of hobbyists and prostituted individuals including escort reviews, site reviews, discussion boards, live chat and guides.</li>
</ul>
<li>USA Sex Guide</li>
<ul>
<li>A free forum for the exchange of information between men who are looking for sex with women.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

Data collection and analysis would include:
<ol>
<li>Top reviewers by screenname</li>
<li>Most reviewed venues</li>
<li>Chat logs searchable by screenname</li>
<li>Delineation of posts/reviews by direct reviews or ongoing conversations between revewiers</li>
</ol>

<b>Project #2</b> Utilizing provided screen names of the top 100 posters on The Erotic Review, analyze their blog posts and direct chatter. Develop a visual social networking tool depicting the relationship between higheset frequency buyers and their: 
<ol>
<li>Buying preferences (i.e., location, time, buying frequency, etc.)</li>
<li>Preferred venues</li>  
<li>Relationships with other review site users</li>
<li>Relationships with known providers</li>
</ol>
