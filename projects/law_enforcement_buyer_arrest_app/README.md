## Law Enforcement Sex Buyer Arrest Application ##

<b>Project Background: </b> Law enforcement agencies across the United States deploy several different operating systems for inputting arrest data. Our law enforcement partners within the CEASE Network have created a specialized paper form to complete after each sex buyer arrest, allowing agencies to capture richer data on their operations. Unfortunately, none of this information is automated and every arrest sheet needs to be inputted manually.

<b>Our Challenge: </b> Develop a tool for law enforcement officials in an agency to input arrest data in real time on their phones. The data could be automatically updated into a centralized database and would be password protected with individual logins for each detective. 

<b>Project #1:</b>  Create the application framework incorporating the following criteria / fields: 

<ol>
<li> Date of Operation </li>
<li> Type of Venue Policed That Resulted in Arrest (Street; Hotel; Brothel; Strip/Dance Club; Bar; "Other") </li>
<li> Age Group of Offender (Under 18; 18 to 30; 31 to 40; 41 to 50; 51 to 60; Over 60) </li>
<li> Race of Offender (Caucasian; Hispanic; African America; Asian; "Other") </li>
<li> Criminal Record? (Yes; No)</li>
<li> Repeat Offender? (Yes; No)</li>
<li> In Possession of a Weapon? (If yes, what type?; No) </li>
<li> Martial Status (Married; In a Relationship; Divorced; Separated; Single) </li>
<li> Highest Level of Education (No HS Diploma or GED; HS Diploma or GED; College Degree; Graduate School) </li>
<li> Offender's Sector of Employment (Agriculture; Construction; Education; Financial Services; Government; Healthcare; Information Technology; Leisure/Hospitality; Manufacturing; Nonprofit; Other Services; Professional & Business Services; Retail; Student; Transportation, Warehousing, Utilities; Unemployed; Wholesale Trade; "Other") </li>
<li> Vehicle Towed/Impounded? (Yes; No)</li>
<li> Fines (Total:__)</li>
<li> # of Charges (Felony:__; Misdemeanor: ___)</li>
<li> DNA Taken? (Yes; No) </li>
<li> Method of Payment for Ads (Pre-paid Card Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Discover; Regular Card Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Discover) </li>
<li> Website Used for Ad Posting (Backpage; Craigslist; Other__) </li>
</ol>

<b>Platform Expansion Ideas:</b> 
<ol>
<li>Create individual profiles for regional agencies</li>
<li>"Share Arrest Record" feature allowing all participating agencies to coordinate across jurisdictions</li>
</ol>

<b>Project #2:</b> Create a tool that scans current arrest PDF documents and automates entries into a database. Analyze database for any reoccuring trends. 

<b>Project Expansion Ideas:</b> Create a dynamic visual dashboard displaying any key findings.  

<b>Project Resources:</b>

<ol>
<li>National Day of Johns Arrest Data</li>
<UL>
<LI>Under the leadership of Sheriff Dart, Cook County (IL) Sheriff’s Office organizes coordinated reverse sting operations across the United States. To date, they have orchestrated nine “National Day of Johns Arrests," with involvement in over 35 different participating law enforcement agencies. They have donated all PDF records from these operations. The most recent sting, which resulted in over 500 arrests, has been manually transcribed for data analysis.</li>
</ul>

<li>Phoenix Arrest Data</li>
