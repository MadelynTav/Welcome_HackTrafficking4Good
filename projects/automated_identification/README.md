##Reverse Search##

<b>Challenge:</b> Because of the increased anonymity the internet provides exploiters, it is becoming increasingly difficult to understand the profile of those who fuel exploitation. Law enforcement agencies and practitioners would greatly benefit from a platform that could aggregate all open source information in order to refine their operations and understand marketplace trends. 



<b>Project #1:</b> Develop a comprehensive automated reverse search platform that compares phone number data to all openly available identification information. This tool would create individual holistic exploiter profiles allowing agencies and practitioners to refine their tactics to stop exploitation. Possible open source information platforms could include: 

<ol>
<li>Social media accounts (demographic data, common usernames, preferences, interests, etc.) </li> 
<li>Employment history</li>
<li>White pages</li>
<li>Media alerts</il>
</ol>

<i>Disclaimer: We do not encourage teams to investigate known illegal activity or suspected individuals.</i>

<b>Project #2:</b> Create a database platform that would generate a profile based on other additional inputs including: dating site screen names, IP addresses, etc.
